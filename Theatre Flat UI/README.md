# Theatre Managing System | WPF UI

During my third-year practice project at the esteemed "Centre of Excellence in Informatics and Information Technologies," I developed and implemented the database and server components of an information system for a theatre using Microsoft SQL Server. The system was designed to manage upcoming performances, their categories, and pricing information, providing a user-friendly interface for actors and theatre visitors.

### Key Features
**Efficient Database Management:** The system allows for seamless management of data in the database, including reading, writing, deleting, and editing records. This ensures that all data operations are smooth and error-free.

**Logical Database Consistency:** Maintaining the logical consistency of the database is a top priority. Data integrity is crucial, and the system ensures that the data remains in a logically consistent state at all times.

**Common Queries and Views:** Users can easily access common queries and views to retrieve the information they need. This feature simplifies the process of finding relevant data within the system.

**Stored Procedures and Triggers:** The system leverages stored procedures and triggers to enforce complex integrity constraints within the database. This ensures that the data remains accurate and reliable.

**Project Description**
This project allowed me to apply my skills in database management and system development in a real-world context. By developing and implementing the database and server components of the Theatre Managing System, I contributed to the smooth operations of the theatre and enhanced the overall experience for both actors and visitors.

The system I created is a testament to the practical application of knowledge gained during my third-year practice project. It provides a user-friendly interface for theatre staff and visitors, offering efficient database management, logical data consistency, and the utilization of database features such as stored procedures and triggers.

This project was a significant learning experience and an opportunity to make a positive impact on the theatre's operations. It demonstrates my ability to design and implement information systems that meet real-world needs and enhance the overall user experience.
