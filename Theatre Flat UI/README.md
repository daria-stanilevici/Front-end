During my third-year practice project at the esteemed "Centre of Excellence in Informatics and Information Technologies," I developed and implemented the database and server components of an information system for a Theatere using Microsoft SQL Server. The system was designed to manage upcoming performances, their categories, and pricing information, providing a user-friendly interface for actors and theatre visitors.

Key functional features of the system include efficient database management (read, write, delete, edit), ensuring logical consistency of the database, implementation of common queries and views for users, and the use of stored procedures and triggers to maintain complex integrity constraints in the database. 

This project allowed me to apply my skills in database management and system development in a real-world context, contributing to the smooth operations of the theatre and enhancing the overall experience for both actors and visitors.
