<!-- 1. The sales agent sells five different products, the prices of which are as follows: 
   product1 - $2.98; 
   product2 - $4.50; 
   product3 - $9.98; 
   product4 - $4.49; 
   product5 - $6.87. 
   
   Create a script that reads a pair of numbers :
   a) Product number (from 1 to 5)
   b) Quantity sold
   
   The program must use the switch operator, which will determine and display the price of each product on the HTML page, as well as calculate the total cost of the products sold. Use the prompt function to enter values. The input of values must be completed by entering the value 0 for the product number -->
