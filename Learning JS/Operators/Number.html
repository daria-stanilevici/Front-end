<!-- 2. Write a loop that prompts prompt to enter a number greater than 100. If the user entered a different number, ask them to enter it again, and so on. The loop should ask for a number until either the user enters a number greater than 100, or presses the Cancel button (ESC). It is assumed that the user enters only numbers. It is not necessary to provide for the processing of non-numeric strings in this task -->
